        In Fight Monsters or Whatever, you are a warrior and a slave to The
        Arena...
        
        To win you must fight three monsters in a row and survive. Each
        monster is randomly selected, and is harder to kill than the one
        before it.
        Should you fell three monsters... you win.
        Should you fall in battle... you lose.

        Both you and your enemy have a pool of health that is displayed
        at the top of the screen. Defeat for either of you is when your health
        reaches 0.

        Conveniently for you, you are a warrier equiped and skilled with:
        * A sword
        * A self-refilling flask of healing potion
        * And the ability to shield yourself with magic

        Before going the ATTACK sub-menu, it's important to know what heppens
        when an attack is made.
            
        1) A 20 sided dice is rolled.

        2) The result of the roll is compared to the 'Armour Class' of your
        opponent. If the result is equal to or higher, you hit. Otherwise
        the attack misses.
        
            eg. You rolled a 10 on an attack against a Goblin. The armour
            class of the Goblin is 8. Seeing as the result is higher than the
            Goblin's Armour Class, you hit the Goblin.

        3) If the attack hits. Damage is rolled depending on the player or
        monster's 'Damage Dice'. For you as the player, this is a D6. For
        monsters this can be a D4, D6, D8, D10 or D12.
        The result of the damage roll is subtracted from the opponent's
        health.
        
        If a 'Critical Hit' is rolled (rolling a result of 20 when rolling to
        hit), you would roll two damage die instead of one.
        
        So to summarise the terminology when an attack is made:

        * ROLLING TO HIT: A 20 sided die (a D20) is rolled when an attack is
        made.

        * ARMOUR CLASS: If the result of the ROLL TO HIT is equal to or higher
        than your opponents ARMOUR CLASS, the attack hits. Otherwise it misses.
        
        * ROLLING DAMAGE: If an attack hits, the appropriate dice is rolled
        and the opponent takes the reult as damage.
        For you this is a D6 (a six sided die), for enemy monsters this can be
        a D4, D6, D8, D10 or a D12!
        
        * CRITICAL HITS: If a 20 is rolled on a D20 to hit, this results in a
        CRITICAL HIT. This means that whichever and how many die that are
        rolled for damage are DOUBLED!
        (eg. 1 D6 for damage becomes 2 D6 of damage.)
        
        Remember that these rules apply for both you and your opponent!"

        When ATTACK is selected from the main menu, a submenu opens. Here you
        can choose THREE different methods of attacking. (If you haven't read
        MAKING AN ATTACK, I suggest you do that first.)

        The three types of attacks are:
        
        * BALANCED: A BALANCED attack results in a standard attack. You roll
        one die to hit and use that result. Your opponent does the same when
        they attack.
        
        * RECKLESS: Being RECKLESS means you'll have the advantage on your
        opponent. When you attack recklessly, two dice are rolled to hit your
        opponent and only the highest reult is used. However, you are attacking
        recklessly so your opponent gains the same advantage. Be sure to use
        caution when using this while a monster is using a special attack.
        Otherwise it's handy for finishing off an opponent who is close to
        death.
        
        * DEFENSIVE: This is similar to attacking recklessly. However fighting
        defensively means your caution makes it both harder to hit your enemy
        and harder for them to hit you. This maneuver means two dice are
        rolled to hit and the lowest value is used. Your opents suffers the
        same effect. This is useful if you are biding your time for your
        shield to recharge or your flask to refill."

        attack.

        Much like the cooldowns on your FLASK and SHIELD, monsters also have
        cooldowns for their SPECIAL ATTACKs. These cooldown times vary from
        monster to monster, as does the type of special attack they perform.
        
        The three types of special attacks are:
        
        * MULTI ATTACK: This allows the monster to attack three times in a row.
        For each attack they still have to roll to hit, but this can be
        affected by whether you are attack RECKLESSLY or DEFENSIVELY like any
        other attack a monster will make. Additionally, if they score a
        CRITICAL HIT, those count as well in a multi attack.
        
        * RESTRAIN: There are a few monster who can restain you with web or
        paralysis. When you are restrained, you will miss your next action and
        The next attack the monster makes will be as though you attacked
        RECKLESSLY.
        
        * BREATH: The most terrifying of all special attacks. Only TIER 3
        monsters have this ability. A breath attack will always hit (unless
        you are blocking) and will deal large amounts of damage. Additionally,
        if you are attacking RECKLESSLY when a monster uses this, you will take
        double damage. Likewise if you attack DEFENSIVELY, you will take half
        damage."
